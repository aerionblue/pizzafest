# Pizza Fest.

This is a bot that tracks bid wars for Twitch streams. The bot watches Twitch
chat for subscription and bit notices and records them in a Google Sheet.
Chatters can type a command in the chat to assign their accumulated credit
towards a bid of their choice.

All the actual math for the bid wars is handled in the spreadsheet.

It was originally made for twitch.tv/usedpizza, but it could be used for other
stuff. If there were instructions. (There aren't. Sorry. Ask if you're
interested.)

## Why a spreadsheet?

It's easy for anybody to edit. If somebody makes a wrong bid by mistake, the
streamer or a mod can just fix it without having to screw around with a
database.
